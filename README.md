## Welcome

The goal of this project is to remake the game "Cogmind" in the Unity Engine. Cogmind is a roguelike indie game developed by Grid Sage Games. As a fan of this game I decided to start this project to add in a couple features of my own and to have greater control over the game. The only assets used from the original game are the Sprites and Audio as well as some text/lore pieces.

This project has been in development on and off since January 12th, 2023. I work on this project whenever I feel like adding something new.

## Getting Started

You can play the game by downloading the latest Demo Build in the `Releases` tab.

Newer builds will be released periodically, but to play the most up to date version of the game, you can download the project files and compile them with `Unity 2022.3.56`.

## Issues

What's with all the open issues? This is essentially my TODO list. Though not comprehensive, it is a way of me organizing my thoughts and priorities, you can see this a bit better if you look in the `Projects` tab.

If you have an issue of your own, feel free to make one and I will take note of it. Appropriate tagging/labeling is greatly appreciated.
