                > Hit Chance
                Melee attacks use the same hit chance calculations as ranged combat, with a few exceptions:
                  -Base hit% is 70
                  -No range modifier
                  -No heat modifiers
                  -Utility modifiers use those applicable to melee combat
                > Momentum
                All melee weapons benefit from greater momentum in the direction of the attack. 
                Moving multiple consecutive spaces in a row prior to an attack adds additional momentum, 
                up to a maximum of 3. Current momentum is displayed as a number at the end of the HUD's movement data readout.

                The damage bonus on a successful melee hit is +1~40% for non-piercing weapons, or +2~80% for piercing weapons, 
                calculated as: ([momentum] * [speed%] / 1200) * 40). For piercing attacks the multiplier is 80 instead of 40. 
                Speed% is current speed as a percentage of average speed, 100. Thus the more momentum and speed with which you attack, 
                the greater the damage. Your status page shows the damage bonus taking current momentum into account. 
                Note that while some utilities help increase momentum, the maximum bonus damage for a given weapon type cannot be exceeded.

                Stopping, performing a non-movement action, or otherwise moving in a direction that does not match the current
                momentum resets your momentum to 0, except when moving diagonally in the same general direction (e.g. turning from southeast to south).
                The latter case instead reduces total momentum by 1. Also note that technically any melee attack can take advantage
                of previously accumulated momentum, regardless of direction. For example, approaching the southern side of a target
                from the east and attacking northward while passing below it will apply whatever momentum value is displayed in the HUD.

                >Sneak Attacks 
                Melee attacking an enemy that has not yet noticed you gives a base hit chance of 120%, 
                and a +100% damage bonus which stacks with any momentum bonus. Sneak attacks work on any non-fleeing neutral targets as well,
                since they don't expect you'll suddenly attack them!

                >Multi-Wielding
                Although only one primary melee weapon can be active at a time, other attached but inactive melee
                weapons have a chance to carry out "follow-up attacks" alongside the primary weapon. 
                In Tactical HUD mode, that chance is shown next to each applicable melee weapon. 
                Follow-up attacks are more likely when the primary weapon is slower than a given backup melee weapon. 
                The chance may also be affected by supporting utilities.

                Multiple follow-up attacks by different melee weapons are possible in the same action.
                Each weapon is checked separately, and once confirmed any follow-up attack has a +10% to hit the target.
                Each weapon incurs no additional time cost to attack aside from modifying the total attack time by half of their time delay
                (whether positive or negative). Momentum bonuses that apply to the primary weapon all apply to follow-up attacks as well.
                The benefits of all actuators also apply to every follow-up attack. If the target is destroyed by an earlier attack,
                any remaining follow-up attacks will switch to another target in range if there is one.

                Datajacks cannot be involved in follow-up attacks, and these attacks are only applicable against robot targets.

        #region Explanation
        /*
         * Coverage/Exposure
        -------------------
        Each part has a "coverage" rating which determines its likeliness to be hit by an incoming attack. 
        Values are relative, so attacks are weighted towards hitting parts with higher coverage. 
        Robot cores also have their own "exposure" rating which determines their likeliness to be hit; 
        this value is considered along with part coverage when determining whether an attack will strike the core. 
        The exact chance of a core/part to be hit is shown in parenthesis after its exposure/coverage on the relevant info screen. 
        You can also press 'c' to have the main HUD's parts list display a visualization of relative coverage, i.e. longer bars represent a greater chance for a given part to be hit.

        Some examples of how coverage determines hit locations will help understand how that stat actually works.

        Example 1: Cogmind's core has an exposure of 100. Say you equip only one part, 
        a weapon which also has a coverage of 100. Their total value is 200 (100+100), 
        so if you are hit by a projectile, each one has a 50% (100/200) chance to be hit.

        Example 2: You have the following parts attached:
            Ion Engine (60)
            Light Treads (120)
            Light Treads (120)
            Medium Laser (60)
            Assault Rifle (100)
        With your core (100), the total is 560, so the chance to hit each location is:
            Ion Engine: 60/560=10.7%
            Light Treads: 120/560=21.4% (each)
            Medium Laser: 60/560=10.7%
            Assault Rifle: 100/560=17.9%
            Core: 100/560=17.9%

        Enemy robots work the same way, so the more parts you blow off, 
        the more likely you are to hit and destroy their core. 
        Armor plating has a very high coverage, so it's more likely to be hit, 
        while tiny utilities such as embedded processors have very low coverage, 
        so you can expect them to last much longer (unless you have little or nothing else covering you). 
        As you progress, your core will become more and more protected by attached parts, 
        because you'll have many more of them, but by that time there are other dangers such as system corruption.

        -----------------
        When a part is destroyed by damage that exceeds its remaining integrity, 
        the surplus damage is then applied directly to the core or another part as chosen by standard coverage/exposure rules. 
        No additional defenses are applied against that damage. 

        Exceptions: 
            -There is no damage overflow if the destroyed part itself is armor, 
            and overflow damage always targets armor first if there is any. 
            -Critical strikes that outright destroy a part can still cause overflow if their original damage amount exceeded the part's integrity anyway. 
            Damage overflow is caused by all weapons except those of the "gun" type, and can overflow through multiple destroyed parts if there is sufficient damage.
