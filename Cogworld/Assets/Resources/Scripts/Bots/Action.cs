    /* Attack Resolution
        -------------------
        With so many mechanics playing into an attack, especially later in the game when there are numerous active parts involved at once, 
        min-maxers looking to optimize their build may want a clearer understanding of the order in which all elements of an attack are carried out. 
        This manual already covered hit chances above, but there are many more steps to what happens once an attack hits a robot. 
        Below is an ordered list detailing that entire process, which applies to both ranged and melee combat. 
        Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.

        1. Check if the attack is a non-damaging special case such as Datajacks, Stasis Beams, Tearclaws, etc., and handle that before quitting early.

        2. Calculate base damage, a random value selected from the weapon's damage range and multiplied by applicable modifiers for overloading, 
        momentum, and melee sneak attacks, in that order. Potential damage range modified by Melee Analysis Suites, Kinecellerators, and Force Boosters here.

        3. Apply robot analysis damage modifier, if applicable (+10%).

        4. Apply link_complan hack damage modifier, if applicable (+25%).

        5. Apply Particle Charger damage modifier, if applicable.

        6. Reduce damage by resistances.

        7. Apply salvage modifiers from the weapon and any Salvage Targeting Computers.

        8. Determine whether the attack caused a critical hit.

        9. Split damage into a random number of chunks if an explosion, usually 1~3. The process from here is repeated for each chunk.

        10. Store the current damage value as [originalDamage] for later.

        11. Apply the first and only first defense applicable from the following list: phase wall, 75% personal shield (VFP etc), 
        Force Field, Shield Generator, stasis bubble, active Stasis Trap, Remote Shield, 50% remote shield (Energy Mantle etc.), Hardlight Generator.

        12. Store the current damage value as [damageForHeatTransfer] for later.

        13. Choose target part (or core) based on coverage, where an Armor Integrity Analyzer first applies its chance to bypass all armor, 
        if applicable, then available Core Analyzers increase core exposure, before finally testing individual target chances normally.

        14. Cancel critical strike intent if that target has applicable part shielding, or if not applicable to target.

        15. If targeting core, apply damage and, if robot survives, check for core disruption if applicable.

        16. If targeting a power source with an EM weapon, check for a chain reaction due to spectrum.

        17. If not a core hit or chain reaction, prepare to apply damage to target part. If the part is Phase Armor or have an active Phase Redirector, 
        first reduce the damage by their effect(s) and store the amount of reduction as [transferredCoreDamage] for later, 
        then if part is Powered Armor reduce damage in exchange for energy (if available), or if part is treads currently in siege mode reduce damage appropriately. 
        If part not destroyed then also check for EM disruption if applicable.

        18. If part destroyed by damage, record any excess damage as overflow. If outright destroyed by a critical hit but damage exceeded 
        part's integrity anyway, any excess damage is still recorded as overflow.

        19. If part was not armor and the attack was via cannon, launcher, or melee, transfer remaining damage to another random target 
        (forcing to a random armor if any exists). Continue transferring through additional parts if destroyed (and didn't hit armor).

        20. If part not destroyed, check whether heat transfer melts it instead.

        21. Apply [transferredCoreDamage] directly to the core if applicable, with no further modifiers.

        22. Apply damage type side effects:

        * Thermal weapons attempt to transfer ([damageForHeatTransfer] / [originalDamage])% of the maximum heat transfer rating, 
          and also check for possible robot meltdown (the effect of which might be delayed until the robot's next turn).

        * Kinetic damage may cause knockback.

        * The amount of EM corruption is based on [originalDamage].

        * Impact damage may cause knockback, and applies corruption for each part destroyed.

                > Hit Chance
                Melee attacks use the same hit chance calculations as ranged combat, with a few exceptions:
                  -Base hit% is 70
                  -No range modifier
                  -No heat modifiers
                  -Utility modifiers use those applicable to melee combat
                > Momentum
                All melee weapons benefit from greater momentum in the direction of the attack. 
                Moving multiple consecutive spaces in a row prior to an attack adds additional momentum, 
                up to a maximum of 3. Current momentum is displayed as a number at the end of the HUD's movement data readout.

                The damage bonus on a successful melee hit is +1~40% for non-piercing weapons, or +2~80% for piercing weapons, 
                calculated as: ([momentum] * [speed%] / 1200) * 40). For piercing attacks the multiplier is 80 instead of 40. 
                Speed% is current speed as a percentage of average speed, 100. Thus the more momentum and speed with which you attack, 
                the greater the damage. Your status page shows the damage bonus taking current momentum into account. 
                Note that while some utilities help increase momentum, the maximum bonus damage for a given weapon type cannot be exceeded.

                Stopping, performing a non-movement action, or otherwise moving in a direction that does not match the current
                momentum resets your momentum to 0, except when moving diagonally in the same general direction (e.g. turning from southeast to south).
                The latter case instead reduces total momentum by 1. Also note that technically any melee attack can take advantage
                of previously accumulated momentum, regardless of direction. For example, approaching the southern side of a target
                from the east and attacking northward while passing below it will apply whatever momentum value is displayed in the HUD.

                >Sneak Attacks 
                Melee attacking an enemy that has not yet noticed you gives a base hit chance of 120%, 
                and a +100% damage bonus which stacks with any momentum bonus. Sneak attacks work on any non-fleeing neutral targets as well,
                since they don't expect you'll suddenly attack them!

                >Multi-Wielding
                Although only one primary melee weapon can be active at a time, other attached but inactive melee
                weapons have a chance to carry out "follow-up attacks" alongside the primary weapon. 
                In Tactical HUD mode, that chance is shown next to each applicable melee weapon. 
                Follow-up attacks are more likely when the primary weapon is slower than a given backup melee weapon. 
                The chance may also be affected by supporting utilities.

                Multiple follow-up attacks by different melee weapons are possible in the same action.
                Each weapon is checked separately, and once confirmed any follow-up attack has a +10% to hit the target.
                Each weapon incurs no additional time cost to attack aside from modifying the total attack time by half of their time delay
                (whether positive or negative). Momentum bonuses that apply to the primary weapon all apply to follow-up attacks as well.
                The benefits of all actuators also apply to every follow-up attack. If the target is destroyed by an earlier attack,
                any remaining follow-up attacks will switch to another target in range if there is one.

                Datajacks cannot be involved in follow-up attacks, and these attacks are only applicable against robot targets.

        #region Explanation
        /*
         * Coverage/Exposure
        -------------------
        Each part has a "coverage" rating which determines its likeliness to be hit by an incoming attack. 
        Values are relative, so attacks are weighted towards hitting parts with higher coverage. 
        Robot cores also have their own "exposure" rating which determines their likeliness to be hit; 
        this value is considered along with part coverage when determining whether an attack will strike the core. 
        The exact chance of a core/part to be hit is shown in parenthesis after its exposure/coverage on the relevant info screen. 
        You can also press 'c' to have the main HUD's parts list display a visualization of relative coverage, i.e. longer bars represent a greater chance for a given part to be hit.

        Some examples of how coverage determines hit locations will help understand how that stat actually works.

        Example 1: Cogmind's core has an exposure of 100. Say you equip only one part, 
        a weapon which also has a coverage of 100. Their total value is 200 (100+100), 
        so if you are hit by a projectile, each one has a 50% (100/200) chance to be hit.

        Example 2: You have the following parts attached:
            Ion Engine (60)
            Light Treads (120)
            Light Treads (120)
            Medium Laser (60)
            Assault Rifle (100)
        With your core (100), the total is 560, so the chance to hit each location is:
            Ion Engine: 60/560=10.7%
            Light Treads: 120/560=21.4% (each)
            Medium Laser: 60/560=10.7%
            Assault Rifle: 100/560=17.9%
            Core: 100/560=17.9%

        Enemy robots work the same way, so the more parts you blow off, 
        the more likely you are to hit and destroy their core. 
        Armor plating has a very high coverage, so it's more likely to be hit, 
        while tiny utilities such as embedded processors have very low coverage, 
        so you can expect them to last much longer (unless you have little or nothing else covering you). 
        As you progress, your core will become more and more protected by attached parts, 
        because you'll have many more of them, but by that time there are other dangers such as system corruption.

            -Critical strikes that outright destroy a part can still cause overflow if their original damage amount exceeded the part's integrity anyway. 
            Damage overflow is caused by all weapons except those of the "gun" type, and can overflow through multiple destroyed parts if there is sufficient damage.

            Heat
        -----------------------------------------------------------------

        Movement, firing weapons, and running power sources and some utilities generates heat, as does being hit by thermal weapons. 
        Some of this heat is naturally dissipated by the core's own heat sinks, but not enough to deal with heat generated by numerous/large energy weapons. 
        Heat sinks and cooling systems can be used to avoid overheating, which can have a wide range of negative effects. 
        Heat is only a significant issue for robots that rely heavily on energy weapons. 
        However, note that when firing a volley the heat produced is averaged over the volley's turn duration rather than being immediately applied all at once.

         <> Side Effects <>
        --------------
        Once heat reaches the "Hot" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled. 
        At "Warning" levels (300+) power sources are likely to shut down. 
        Many more serious (and permanent) effects are possible, especially at higher heat levels.

        Disabled power sources automatically restart when possible, but other parts must be manually reactivated.

        Heat effects are not calculated until after the dissipation phase, so heat can temporarily spike
        very high with no side effects as long as there are sufficient utilities to dissipate it.

         <> Cooling Resolution <>
        --------------------
        Eventually you will discover a range of different mechanics that factor into heat management, 
        especially with regard to cooling parts, thus knowing the specific order of operations between them may be of help for min-maxers seeking to optimize a build. 
        Below is a list of heat-related processes that play out once per turn. 
        Note that you most likely DO NOT need to know this stuff, but it may help answer a few specific questions min-maxers have about prioritization.

        1. Add heat from all sources, including that generated by active attached parts, gradual heat from an ongoing weapon volley, and any ambient heat. 
           Spread combined volley heat across its duration, in other words a 3-turn volley which according to its weapon properties generates 100 heat adds 33 heat per turn until complete.

        2. If used the unique "ITN" artifact, automatically drop heat to 250 if above that value.

        3. Subtract innate heat dissipation.

        4. Subtract heat dissipation from direct cooling utilities such as Heat Sinks and Cooling Systems.

        5. If heat exceeds 200, apply dissipation effects of disposable cooling systems such as Coolant Injectors, 
           up to that threshold. If more disposable systems than necessary, apply them in random order.

        6. If heat exceeds 200, apply self-damaging ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Ablative Armor. 
           If using multiple ablative systems at once, dissipation is split into equal-sized chunks for each, 
           where if one system fails, the entire chunk it is responsible for is still successfully dissipated.

        7. If heat exceeds 200, apply broad-effect ablative cooling systems such as Mak. Microdissipator Network.

        --------------
         <> Side Effects <>
        --------------
        Once heat reaches the "Hot" level (200+), active utilities and weapons may be temporarily disabled. 
        At "Warning" levels (300+) power sources are likely to shut down. 
        Many more serious (and permanent) effects are possible, especially at higher heat levels.

        Disabled power sources automatically restart when possible, but other parts must be manually reactivated.

        Heat effects are not calculated until after the dissipation phase, so heat can temporarily spike
        very high with no side effects as long as there are sufficient utilities to dissipate it.
