  description: Provides a cumulative 3% chance to temporarily trick any common 0b10
    combat robot system encountered hostiles on the depth above this one into believing
    it is allied with Cogmind. After 10 turns the network will perform an automated
    quickboot to restore it to normal, a process which takes anywhere from 5 to 10
    turns. The effect is less likely to occur on the depth above that (only 1% chance),
    and it is capped at 15%.
