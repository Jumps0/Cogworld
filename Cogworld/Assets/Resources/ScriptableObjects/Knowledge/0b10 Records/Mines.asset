  lore: "\tDeep underground areas newly excavated to provide access to raw materials
    for processing in the lower levels of Complex 0b10. Initially the mining tunnels
    only rarely experienced hostile Derelict activity, not enough to justify allocating
    significant resources to defense. This has recently changed with the Infestation,
    for which the current response is to dispatch garrisoned Demolishers until a
    more permanent solution can be put in place."
