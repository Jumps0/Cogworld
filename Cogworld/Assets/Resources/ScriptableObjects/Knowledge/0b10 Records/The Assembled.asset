  lore: Given this name by the Derelicts, these robots of integrated construction
    are created seemingly at random by larger mobile factories. They form sudden
    groups, often in the most unexpected of places, and attack almost everything.
    I can discern no pattern in their behavior, though as their hostility is not
    directed solely towards Complex 0b10 and my robots it seems that their creator's
    intent is to instigate something larger while disrupting my own operations.
