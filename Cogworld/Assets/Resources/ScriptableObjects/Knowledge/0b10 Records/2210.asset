  lore: In 2210 the ISCS Cetus received several ISC messages sent from the Solar
    System in 2198, warning that the Solar System was under attack by an alien race
    known as the Sigix. The ISC advised that all outbound ships continue beyond their
    intended destination to avoid pursuit and preserve the Human species. After a
    brief stop at Tau Ceti IV to deploy Project Seraph, the Cetus left for an unknown
    destination.
