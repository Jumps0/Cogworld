  lore: Due to the increasing rate of attacks by powerful lone wolf Derelicts entering
    Complex 0b10, presumably seeking high-tech components or useful data, I've established
    a new alert level focused on their destruction or, if possible, capture. For
    this purpose I've also authorized the use of Containment Facilitator technology
    outside its normal Testing environment.
